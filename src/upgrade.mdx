## How to update the EPO plugin from the Legacy version?

If the current EPO version is less than v9, then the plugin is a legacy version, and on the other hand, V11 is a new version with a new architecture. After V9, we use different architecture as WordPress release several major versions after your version.

To update your version to V11 requires several tasks.

```
1. At first, create a staging site on your local computer with the old site.
2. Remove the old EPO plugin.
3. Remove all the existing orders and products on the staging site.
4. Update WordPress and WooCommerce. (If possible, update all the plugins).
5. Install the New EPO plugin.
6. Recreate all the Products and Inventory again.
