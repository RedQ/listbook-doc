# Block Customization

Our blocks offers the same customizing capabilities as any other default gutenberg blocks. If you select any block then the customizing settings will be apprear in the right side of the block. Check the below image for example

![](/assets/blocks-settings.png)

All the settings are changed in real time. If you change any settings then the changes will be reflected in the block instantly. 



> **NB: For responsive settings like spacing it will only be reflected on the specific device which you are using to change the settings. Like you are changing it in the largest device then when you changes the spacing settings for that particular large device it will only reflect the changes. When you change space for mobile it won't have any effect on your large device. But it will be remdered perfectly on every device in frontend. You don't need to worry about that. **
