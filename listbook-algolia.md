# Listbook Algolia

This plugin is used to sync your local data with `Algolia` and providing fast and reliable search using Algolia. In the plugin you need to do two things.

* Configure using Algolia API Keys
* Sync all listing using the `Sync All` button from the algolia settings. 

We have already discussed everything about configuring algolia in our `Plugin Configuration` chapter. Follow that instruction if you haven't already configured that. If you have configured that before importing the demo data then you might not need  the Sync All. But still for being sure you can sync all data you won't lose any data.

Now for syncing all data to algolia you have to press the `Sync All` button the from the `Listbook Algolia` Dashboard menu.

> **This syncing process is a asynchronous process it will sync your data in background. When done it will show an admin notice in any of your admin page. You can cross the notice it won't show again.**
