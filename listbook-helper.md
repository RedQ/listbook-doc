# Listbook Helper

Listbook Helper is the main helper plugin for the theme. In this plugin below tasks is done

1. Creating `listing` post type.
2. Creating `Taxonomies` for `listing`
3. Creating all the blocks
4. Creating the page settings. 

To add/edit the listing for admin you will get a `Listings` menu in the admin Dashboard. From there you can add `listing` and `taxonomies`. Its pretty simple basic wordpress things. So we are not discussing it in details here.
